	Desc:		Assignment 5: LAMPORT'S ALGORITHM FOR VIRTUAL TOPOLOGY NETWORKS

a nonproduction implementation of LAMPORT's "bakery" algorithm which utilizes clocks (a 'ticketing' system like IN the bakery or at the dept of motor vehicles) to determine which process may go into the critical section next.
	
LAMPORT implemented as described IN "Algorithms FOR Mutual Exclusion", M. Raynal	MIT PRESS Cambridge, 1986 ISBN: 0-262-18119-3 with additional revisions due to message passing across a virtual topology
